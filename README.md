Sources of noise:

* Walking
* Pulling the car into the garage on the other side of the wall
* taping down the "do not touch" sign
* running the laundry machines
* jostling the USB cabe or A/D box (transmits vibrations)

To Do:

* longer term setup for collection (odroid?)
* wireless (for various reasons, including avoiding vibrations coming in from a physical wire)
